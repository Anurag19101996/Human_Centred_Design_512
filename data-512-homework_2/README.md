# Exploring Bias in Wikipedia Data

## Project Overview
This project explores the potential biases present in Wikipedia data by analyzing the coverage and quality of articles on political figures from various countries. Using article data collected from Wikipedia and population data, we apply machine learning predictions from ORES to assess article quality. This analysis helps highlight disparities in coverage and article quality by country and region.

## Goals
Analyze Wikipedia's coverage of politicians by country and compare it to population data.
Determine the quality distribution of these articles and observe any disparities across countries and regions.
Reflect on the impact of data bias and its implications for Wikipedia and broader data science applications.
